# @gigya-ts/web-sdk - Example Project

This project demonstrates how to use the Gigya Web SDK with TypeScript.

See [@gigya-ts/web-sdk](/packages/web-sdk/README.md) for more information.

> This example uses the API Key from the offical [Gigya Demo Website](https://gigyademo.com/) for demonstration purposes. The example calls the `accounts.getSchema` API method and prints the result to the page. This only works on `localhost` or a domain that is registered with the API Key.

## Running the example

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tswymer/gigya-ts.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd gigya-ts && pnpm install
```

3. Navigate to the example project:

```bash
cd examples/web-sdk
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
